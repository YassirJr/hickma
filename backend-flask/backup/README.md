This project implements a nearest neighbor recommender system using Python and scikit-learn.

## Description

The recommender system is designed to read data from a CSV file, allow the user to specify which columns to analyze for similarity, and use K-Nearest Neighbors to find and display items similar to a user's input.

## Setup

To set up and run this project:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone [your-repository-url] (will be added to a github repo later on)
   cd [your-repository-directory] (same)
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure Python is installed on your system. Then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the project**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to input the required fields:
- Columns for similarity analysis, separated by commas.
- Number of nearest neighbors.
- Values for each of the specified columns.

The system will output the rows from the dataset that are closest to the provided input, based on the specified fields.

### Notes:

- Replace `[your-repository-url]` and `[your-repository-directory]` with the actual URL and directory name of your project's repository.
- This README assumes a basic knowledge of Git and Python environment management. If your intended users are less familiar with these tools, consider adding more detailed setup instructions.
- The `README.md` is designed to be simple and direct, suitable for small projects or educational purposes. For a more complex project, consider adding sections on testing, architecture, and detailed configuration options.
